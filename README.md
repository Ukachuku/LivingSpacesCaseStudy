# LivingSpacesCaseStudy

---
Here are some details on the project I’d like you to do.

Assume that the snapshots below are for two of our customer segments (all customers and customers who at some point purchased a Magnolia Homes product from us). Using publicly available census data, build a Tableau dashboard that we could use to highlight potential media opportunities in LA. We can talk through your dashboard when you come in. Note that what I’m looking to see is how you think about the problem and the direction that you go with the numbers you find. I want to talk through your process and hear you explain some of your choices more than I’m interested in what your exact answer is.
